TODO:

Short-term:
Check if demos still work
Migrate computation methods to static instance

Long-term:
✔️ Add all basic math operators
More setTo functions
Be able to cast an int to a DecaInt (if its possible)
Better syntax for using the class (no unnecessary params)
Overloaded methods (for example, divide DecaInt by int value)
Add more complex operators
✔️ (kinda, maybe fixed?) Fix broken file structure of this repo / proper package things

Very long-term:
Add 16/64/128 bit version
